# hmm-cyrptanalysis
Hidden Markov Model for Criptanalysis

The code in hmm.cpp can be executed with an excrypted text-file to obtain a decryption of the text by analyzing the B matrix in the output.

digraph.cpp can be used in case state-transition matrix is not known. This code analyses the text and creates a matrix with probability of 
transition between different alphabets in the ciphertext.
